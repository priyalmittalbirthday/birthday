        A very wise man once said to me, fights happen in a place where you care and expect
        from the other one.
        So this one is for the crazy fights we have had.
        I know i say a lot of things that i should not say and they hurt you. But trust me most of
        the times you get me wrong or misunderstand the context of what I was saying.
        I know we love each other a lot and we have developed a sense of possesiveness for
        each other. <br>
        But mitti I CARE ABOUT YOU A LOT. And you hold the otmost
        priority in my life. (Mitti: But apke actions se to lagta ni hai) <br>
        I know what you think but really trust me on this. <br>
        You actually hold the top spots.
        You do not have a slightest of idea how much hurt I get when you say such things. <br>
        I just want to say I AM SORRY if I have ever hurt you with my stupid words or actions
        and for the future actions also. <br>
        This should go without saying, but you are very special to me and no matter what
        you will be my Numero Ono.
