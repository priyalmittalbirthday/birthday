        Ok So this is basically the most under appericiated part of our friendship.
        We take it as a very normal thing and never realise it how special it is actually.
        Untill the time you went to New York and left me alone. I swear i never feel like
        eating alone. We started from the days when I shared my chicken with you
        and since then we share out food.
        I believe food played a very important role in our friendship.
        <br>
        Be it the time we shared my chicken <br>
        The time when you left me having food alone in curry. <br>
